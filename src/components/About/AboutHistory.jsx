            <p>Namaste's story begins in May 2015 in Ananindeua, Par√°, Brazil. Founded by Maria Silva, a passionate yogi, Namaste was born out of her deep love for yoga and her desire to bring its transformative power to her local community.</p>
            <p>Maria's personal journey with yoga had a profound impact on her life, providing a sense of balance and inner peace. Motivated by this transformation, she established Namaste as a sanctuary for yoga and mindfulness.</p>
            <p>Over the years, Namaste has flourished, offering a diverse range of classes and becoming a center for personal growth and holistic well-being in the heart of Ananindeua. The community has grown, and Namaste continues to inspire and guide individuals on their own paths to well-being and self-discovery, just as Maria's own journey was illuminated by the practice of yoga.</p>
